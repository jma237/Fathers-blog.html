          <h2>The Challenge of Fatherhood</h2>
          <p>Time, as simplistic as it sounds. Is one of the primary struggles dads face worldwide. Allocating the time for all of our responsiblities seems impossible. Balance is key. Creating a system to manage the load of being a leader, husband, and father. Is a way to minimize the overwhelming challenege of fatherhood.
          </p>
          <h3>Importance of being a Father</h3>
          <p>A father's importance is sometimes overlooked. We help our children find who they are as people. Building self confidence, providing support, and saftey, allows our children to grow individually. It sounds harmonious. But in reality, we also prepare our children for the harshness of the world. As negative as it sounds. There is great importance in having a realistic view of what our children might face in the future.
          </p>
          <p>Yes, being a father can be stressfull. Trying to support the family finacially takes a toll. Especially when you want to allocate your time to raising your children. But being stable is one of the greatest things you can offer your family. It allows you and your family, the ability to foucs on life not the burdens that it brings. Even though, that means you take on the burdens of the world. You can express the struggles of the world, with a clear mind and solutions to your children.</p>
          <p>Now, I know it may seem more stress then peace. But being a father is beautiful. Emotionally being strong, giving your children a safe place to be themselves. Protecting and provding, is what we as fathers believe is our most important duty. That I would agree, but being a positive role model is wildly under discussed. Your children will look at you for guidance and wisdom. Living a good, and healthy life can have the greatest of impacts on a young mind. We want to show our children how to treat others and themsleves. So be open to discussion. Be supportive in their emotions. Express the importance in stability. Show them how proud you are to be their father. Thats how we as fathers are important.</p>
